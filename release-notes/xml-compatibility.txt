Version: 3.1

Current version is very close to complete XML 1.0 compliance; and also
mostly XML 1.1 compliant. In addition to the core xml specification,
Woodstox implements following specifications:

* Xml Namespaces (1.0 and 1.1)
* Xml:id

Known issues regarding strict XML-conformance checking are:

XML 1.0:

* Surrogate pairing checks for identifiers (element and attribute names,
  PI targets) is slightly incomplete, resulting in 4 failing XMLTest test
  cases.
* Validity checks for characters 0xFFFE and 0xFFFF does not work for
  UTF-16 encoding (need to implement custom reader). Results in 2 failing
  XMLTest test cases.
* Namespace declaration pseudo-attributes are always dealt as being
  type CDATA, even if DTD declares otherwise: this means that the white
  space included will not be normalized (one failing XMLTest test cases)

XML 1.0:

[no known 1.0 specific additional problems]

XML 1.1:
