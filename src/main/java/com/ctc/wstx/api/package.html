Package that contains subset of Woodstox classes that are considered to be
its public API (in addition to regular Stax 1.0 -- javax.xml.stream.* -- and
Stax2 -- org.codehaus.stax2.*). This means that application code can rely
on these classes, and effort is made to keep them backwards compatible
between releases.
