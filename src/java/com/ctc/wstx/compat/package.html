Package that contains classes that allow abstracting out the details of
JDK platform version being used. Currently classes are used to implement
"graceful degradation" of functionality, when certain JDK classes are only
fully implemented as part of JDKs later than the minimum version
Woodstox needs for running (for Woodstox versions up to 3.x it was JDK 1.2, for 4.x JDK 1.4).
